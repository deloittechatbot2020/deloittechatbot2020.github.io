## What’s a REST API, anyway?

An [API](http://www.komposta.net/article/navgoco) is an application programming interface - in short, it’s a set of rules that lets programs talk to each other, exposing data and functionality across the internet in a consistent format.
REST stands for 
* Bootstrap framework
* [Navgoco multi-level sidebar](http://www.komposta.net/article/navgoco) for table of contents
* Ability to specify different sidebars for different products
* Top navigation bar with drop-down menus
* Notes, tips, and warning information notes
* Tags for alternative navigation
* Advanced landing page layouts from the [Modern Business theme](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/modern-business/).
